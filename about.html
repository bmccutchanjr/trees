		<main>
			<p>This page is intended to assist designers of "trees" logic puzzles verify their puzzles.  It has two
			main functions; validator and solver.</p>

			<p>This application can be configured for one, two or three tree puzzles with 8 to 16 rows and columns.</p>

			<p>Validator</p>
			<p>Validator utilizes a brute force branching tree algorthm to find all solutions to a puzzle.  No
			logical inferences are made about the puzzle or the puzzle configuration.  Validator simply attempts to
			place a "tree" in every cell of the puzzle where a tree might ba allowed allowed according tree logic rules
			and the puzzle configuration.  Once a tree is succesfully inserted, validator attempts to place a tree in
			the next cell.</p>

			<p>Validator will continue in this fashion until the puzzle in solved or (more likely) the placement of
			trees produces an invalid solution.  If a solution is invalid, validator abandons the current branc of the
			tree and continues from the last legally valid tree.</p>

			<p>Validator looks at every possible configuration of trees and will find all (hopefully just one)
			solutions.</p>

			<p>Validator can take a VERY long time to run.</p>

			<p>Solver</p>
			<p>Solver is used to demonstrate a puzzle can be solved withlogic alone.  It uses the same logic a person
			might and attempts to solve the puzzle directly, applying them repeatedly until the puzzle is solved or
			it is unable to make additional progress.</p>

			<p>Note that solver will always be a work in progress and may not be capable of solving every puzzle.  New
			rules can be added, increasing solver's 'expertise'.</p>
